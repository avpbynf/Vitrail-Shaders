/**
 * Turns one flattened pack unit into GLSL a Vulkan compiler will take.
 * <p>
 * The pack dialect is GLSL 120 with OptiFine's additions: fixed function state, {@code varying}
 * and {@code attribute}, texture lookups renamed twenty years ago, and plain uniforms declared
 * loose at file scope, which Vulkan does not allow at all. None of that needs the program to be
 * understood, only read, so the work here is a rewrite over a token stream rather than a compiler.
 * <p>
 * Two things are deliberately left undone, and both were done by the measuring prototype.
 * No {@code layout(binding = )} is emitted, and no {@code layout(location = )} except on fragment
 * outputs. The game's own compiler assigns both from SPIR-V reflection and rewrites them
 * afterwards, so a number chosen here is at best ignored and at worst collides with a number
 * chosen for another unit of the same pack. When the prototype was made to number them across a
 * whole pack rather than per file, colliding locations became its largest class of failure by
 * far. Fragment outputs keep theirs, because their order is what maps a write onto a colour
 * attachment and nothing else records that.
 * <p>
 * Conditionals are left standing. The unit that arrives here still carries every {@code #if} of
 * every file that was spliced into it, and the compiler will evaluate them again, so the engine's
 * own symbols are written into the header rather than assumed: if the compiler read them
 * differently from the expander, it would take a different branch and fail somewhere unrelated.
